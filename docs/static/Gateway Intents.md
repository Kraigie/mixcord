# Gateway Intents

The Discord API allows you to find tune the payloads that are received by your bot, gateway intents.

When connecting to Discord you can instruct Discord on what events you want to receive (i.e. messages, user presences, etc.).

Nostrum allows you to set these intents within your configuration, **by default all intents are enabled**.

To pass intents you should use the following configuration:
```elixir
config :nostrum,
  token: "bot_token",
  num_shards: :auto,
  gateway_intents: [
      :guilds,
      # other gateway intents
  ]
```

Possible options (and the events they correspond to) are:

```
guilds:
  - GUILD_CREATE
  - GUILD_UPDATE
  - GUILD_DELETE
  - GUILD_ROLE_CREATE
  - GUILD_ROLE_UPDATE
  - GUILD_ROLE_DELETE

```

Note that intents marked with `*` are **privileged** intents. You must enable these intents by visiting the Discord Developer portal.

Once your bot passes 100 servers Discord will force you to **verify your bot**. If you require privileged intents you may need to write additional information on your usage of them.

Be advised that since Nostrum defaults to all intents being enabled you may need to disable these intents by adding everything else in the above list to the `gateway_intents` configuration option.
